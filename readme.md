# [React and Typescript: Build a Portfolio Project](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-and-typescript-build-a-portfolio-project/)

## About this course

Expand your portfolio of projects by building a complex app with the latest web technologies.

## Description

You've learned React, but what now? **_Time to build an awesome project for your portfolio!_**

Prove your React knowledge to employers.

There are hundreds of resources online for teaching you the basics of React, but few of them go beyond the basics. You need more - something to teach you **_how to build a large, interesting app._** Something unique, something more than another to-do list.

**_This course is your answer._**

Kick off your learning experience with an introduction on how to use **_React and Typescript together._** Not familiar with Typescript? No problem! A lightning fast - but comprehensive - tutorial is included!

Once you're ready with React and Typescript, you'll dive into our big project. **_You are going to build an interactive browser-based coding environment._** It's like a Jupyter Notebook, but for Javascript, with many additional features added in. Yes, this is what you are going to build in this course! You will solve incredible challenges around _bundling and transpiling code directly in the browser_. This is a task normally done by running Webpack and Babel at your terminal! You will execute users' code safely in the browser just like how famous services like CodeSandBox and CodePen do. Finally, you'll deploy this project using a multi-package architecture to NPM, where your friends and employers can easily download and run your project.

During this entire project, I will show you a variety of _different solutions_ to an incredible number of problems. I will show you step-by-step how to solve each problem. You will also see many concerns around performance and security addressed.

At the end of the course, you will have **_an amazing portfolio project_** with excellent looks and functionality. You will understand every line of code, and be able to explain every bit to potential employers.

Here's a partial list of the topics that will be covered in this course:

- Master the use of **_React, Redux, and Typescript_** together
- Build a complex and interesting app using a **_package-based architecture_**
- Understand the challenges of in-browser **_code transpiling_** and and processing
- Secure your app against potential security exploits
- Safely execute user-provided code directly in the browser
- **_Run a code editor_** directly in the browser - the same editor used by VSCode!
- Leverage **_Web Assembly_** to run a code bundler directly in the browser at lightning-fast speeds
- Use the **_internals of Redux_** to manually test out your business logic
- Discover dozens of tricks to build a **_sleek UI_**
- Deploy your app to the **_NPM registry_**, where others can easily use it
